Hi. I'm Jason. This is my personal website. During business hours, [I develop websites for UC Santa Cruz](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=jchafin).

This is site is a learning laboratory. I chisel away at it on my free time. My [posts](/posts/) are typically "How tos," mostly for my own reference but in the spirit of transparency, I hope someone else might benefit from them, too. I've got a [to do list](https://github.com/Herm71/jc-eleventy/issues) that I check periodically.

There's more about me on my [about page](/about/).
