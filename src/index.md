## Welcome

This is my personal website, a gradual work in progress. It might not look like much at the moment but just you wait, pretty soon [it's gonna be awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCDq_InioQE). In the meantime, I've got [my to do list](https://herm-garden.netlify.app/jc-website-todo/).

During business hours, [I develop websites for UC Santa Cruz](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=jchafin), so I chisel away at this on my free time (when I'm not playing guitar).  

Please see my [about](/about/) page for more information.
