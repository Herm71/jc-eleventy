Hi. I'm Jason. This is my personal website. During business hours, [I develop websites for UC Santa Cruz](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=jchafin).

This site might not look like much at the moment, but just you wait. Pretty soon [it's gonna be awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCDq_InioQE). I chisel away at this site on my free time (when I'm not playing guitar). I've got a [to do list](https://herm-garden.netlify.app/jc-website-todo/) that I check periodically.

Meanwhile, to learn more about me, please see my [about](/about/) page.
