Hi. I'm Jason. This is my former Eleventy website. I've moved back to WordPress but am keeping this up for posterity. It was a great learning experience and I was able to do some clever things here. I love Static Site Generators. Visit my [main website](https://jasonchafin.com) for more about me.

This is site is a learning laboratory. I chisel away at it on my free time. I've got a [to do list](https://github.com/Herm71/jc-eleventy/issues) that I check periodically.
