## Welcome

I am a web developer in [Santa Cruz, CA](https://www.cityofsantacruz.com/). I work for [UC Santa Cruz](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=jchafin) where I develop web applications that support the University’s mission and purpose. I also play guitar. My [bio](/bio) has a longer version of who I am. My [CV](/curriculum-vitae) has a decent run down of my education and skills.
