I was raised in Southern California's [Inland Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Empire) city of [San Bernardino](https://www.sbcity.org/). After graduating from [San Gorgonio High School](https://sangorgonio.sbcusd.com/) in 1989, I moved north to attend college at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://ucsc.edu) where I earned a Bachelor's Degree in [Environmental Studies](https://envs.ucsc.edu/) in 1993.

I was hired by the [Sacramento Tree Foundation](https://sactree.org/) after college, so I and moved to [Sacramento](https://www.cityofsacramento.gov/), CA for a couple of years. While in Sacto, I took the [GRE](https://www.ets.org/gre.html) and applied to graduate school. In 1995, I headed north again to [Olympia](https://www.olympiawa.gov/), WA to pursue a [Master of Environmental Studies](https://www.evergreen.edu/academics/graduate-studies/master-environmental-studies) degree at [The Evergreen State College](https://www.evergreen.edu/).

After graduating from Evergreen in 1997, I returned to [Santa Cruz](https://www.cityofsantacruz.com/) and began my ***first career*** as an [Urban and Environmental Planner](../curriculum-vitae/#urban-planning) with the now-defunct [Pacific Municipal Consultants](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/108326-44#overview) in their [Monterey](https://monterey.gov/) office. I spent five years with PMC, consulting on planning projects up and down California's [Central Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_(California)) -- from [San Luis Obispo](https://www.slocity.org/) to Santa Cruz.

In 2003, I was hired by [Lamphier-Gregory](https://lamphier-gregory.com/), an environmental analysis and urban planning firm in [Oakland](https://www.oaklandca.gov/), CA. In seven years with Lamphier-Gregory, I worked on planning projects throughout the [San Francisco Bay Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area) and the northern end of [California's Central Valley](https://ca.water.usgs.gov/projects/central-valley/about-central-valley.html).

I was laid off by Lamphier-Gregory in 2010 as a result of [The Great Recession](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-recession-and-its-aftermath). While searching for work "in my field," I began learning the basics of web development by tinkering with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). I'd always had an aptitude for things technical and I was already a hobbyist at building computers and other bits of hardware; so moving into web development was a logical next step.

Initially I was self taught. But I eventually found that there were many "[unknown unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns)" in web development that I couldn't answer myself -- I didn't even know the right questions to ask!

I learned many of those right questions, and the answers to them, by attending weekly [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/) at a great local Oakland resource called [Tech Liminal](https://techliminal.com/). In 2011, knowing just enough about WordPress to be dangerous, I officially took my first steps along the path of my ***second career*** and became a "[web developer](../curriculum-vitae/#web-development)."

I freelanced for a couple of years, improving my skills. I acquired a few clients, developed a portfolio and continued attending weekly Meetups at Tech Liminal. It was from those weekly Meetups that I learned of an open position at an Oakland WordPress web development firm, [Hyperarts](https://www.hyperarts.com/). I interviewed with them and was hired as a contract web developer at the end of 2012. I worked as a contractor for Hyperarts while continuing my freelance work until 2017.

In the Spring of 2017, an employment agency found a resume I'd uploaded to an online job board some three years earlier. Soon after, they contacted me and asked if I was interested in a six-month position at UC Santa Cruz, my *alma mater*. The person whose position I would fill was on medical leave.

Even though it was *only for six months*, I jumped at the opportunity. So in the Summer of 2017, after well over a decade in Oakland, I moved back to Santa Cruz to start work as a contract web developer in the [Communications and Marketing](https://communications.ucsc.edu/) Department of UCSC's [University Advancement](https://advancement.ucsc.edu/) Division.

About half-way through my six-month contract, I learned that the person whose position I was filling would not be returning and that the university was opening the position for recruitment. Although I was already in the position as a contractor, if I wanted the job, I needed to go through official channels and submit my resume into the pool along with the other applicants. On the other hand, having already demonstrated my skills to those who would be making the hiring decisions doubtless gave me an advantage. And if it didn't work out in my favor, I still had the remainder of my six month contract to figure out what to do next.

As luck (and maybe a little skill) would have it, I was hired. On the first of the year in 2018, I started in my current role as [Senior Web Developer](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=jchafin) on UCSC's [Communications and Marketing Digital Strategies Team](https://advancement.ucsc.edu/about/the-team/communications-and-marketing/#digital-strategies). As of this writing, this is where I remain today.
