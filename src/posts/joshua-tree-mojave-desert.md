I visited [Joshua Tree National Park](https://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm), the town of [Joshua Tree](https://www.joshuatree.directory/joshua-tree-main) and the Mojave Desert in the Summer of 2022 and the Spring of 2023. The Spring trip was during one of [California's wettest years](https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-enjoying-increasingly-rare-back-to-back-wet-winters/) in recent memory.

The images in this post combine my two trips to the area.

## Joshua Tree National Park

I visited the park on my July 2022 visit. I took fewer photos than I probably should have. This is because, like an idiot, I didn't bring water. Just inside the park entrance is a restroom with water fountains and as I entered the park, I pulled in to use the facilities. So the only water I had for this entire visit was the four or five gulps I took at the entrance water fountain. Suffice it to say, that is not enough water for a Joshua Tree visit. I was reminded of my stupidity often during my visit, as there are signs every several hundred feet along any route you take that say **_Do Not Die Today_**. By the time my visit ended, I kinda thought I was gonna.

## Town of Joshua Tree

{% sidebar "The Joshua Tree Grid" "sidebar right" %}
<p>As a <a href="/about/curriculum-vitae/#:~:text=Urban%20%26%20Environmental%20Planning">former urban planner</a>, I am fascinated by the "street grid" laid out seemingly in the middle of nowhere. With names like <em>Sunburst Ave</em> and <em>La Crescenta Dr</em>, the "streets" are mostly unpaved roads connecting vast expanses of desert. With "blocks" approximatey 675 by 1314 feet, they are much larger a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_block">typical city block of 330 by 660 feet</a>. But  since it <em>is</em> a grid, it's fairly easy to navigate.</p>

{% endsidebar %}

The "town" of Joshua Tree (it's actually a Census Designated Area) and its environs has many fun things to do. The [Joshua Tree Saloon](https://www.joshuatreesaloon.com/) is the perfect stop for a libation after a hike through the park. There are also lots of art galleries nearby to peruse, including the [World Famous Crochet Museum](https://www.joshuatree.directory/crochet-museum), which appears to have been built from an old [Fotomat kiosk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fotomat).

### Pioneertown

A few miles out of town is [Pioneertown](https://visitpioneertown.com/), a "living breathing movie set" built in 1946 and backed by the likes of [Dale Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Evans), [Roy Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Rogers) and his singing group, the [Sons of the Pioneers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_the_Pioneers), who wrote and recorded a promotional tune for the endeavor called "[Out in Pioneertown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpteOBEc24U)."

I visited [Pappy and Harriet's](https://pappyandharriets.com/) in Pioneertown in the Summer of 2022. Pappy and Harriet's is a "magical desert roadhouse" featuring live music, [Santa Maria style BBQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria%E2%80%93style_barbecue) (rivaling anything coming out of Texas) and plenty of booze. The only image I got from that visit is of their unique adobe wall, which has bottles beautifully embedded into it. Reason enough to return.

## Transmission

Several miles outside town is the [Mojave Moon Ranch](https://www.themojavemoon.com/), a private space that hosts a majestic 28ft tall concrete sculpture called [Transmission](https://www.themojavemoon.com/tranmission), by multiplidisciplanary artist [Daniel Popper](https://danielpopper.com/). While the property is private (it's available for booking, AirBnB, etc.), they have been kind enough to provide, a [public viewing location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XxDK6Bej2ZcdV2ZQ7) so cheapskates like me can enjoy its majesticity.

## Hicksville Trailor Palace

{% image "./src/assets/images/hicksville/teepee-suffleboard.jpg", "image of Hicksville sunset", "Hicksville Dusk", "image-align-wide", "(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"  %}

If you decide to visit this area and you're looking for accommodations, do yourself a favor and check out [Hicksville Trailor Palace](https://www.hicksvillepalace.com/). I stayed there both times on my recent visits. This place is awesome. Out in the middle of nowhere, Hicksville is an oasis of kitsch, in the best possible way. The property features ten trailers (and a [zombie safe bunker](https://www.hicksvillepalace.com/projectz)), a pool, an arcade, shuffleboard, an archery/bb-gun range, a put-put golf course, and a vending machine where you can select items like the vodka tonic package, the S'mores package or the [Plan B morning-after pill](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/whats-plan-b-morning-after-pill) package.

Also, Hicksville's jukebox is epic. It has every song you've ever heard by every band you clould ever think of.(Additionally, the jukebox is the only amplified speaker allowed, as [personal speakers or boom boxes are not permitted](https://www.hicksvillepalace.com/faqs).)

All trailers on the property have themes. For instance, there's [The Lux](https://www.hicksvillepalace.com/the-lux-trailer), which pays homage to legendary punk rock psychobilly band [The Cramps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cramps). And [The Pee-wee](https://www.hicksvillepalace.com/the-peewee-trailer), the actual "Conastoga wagon" featured in the Pee-wee Herman film [Big Top Pee-wee](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094744/). There's also [The New World](https://www.hicksvillepalace.com/the-new-world-trailer), a mid-century modern 50's style trailer where [Johnny Depp and Amanda Heard had their knockdown-dragout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXD884AjZyQ&pp=ygUPI3dpdG5lc3N0cmFpbGVy).

So far, I've stayed in The Fifi and The Pee-Wee. If you stay in all of them they put your name on their special wall.

### Spotlight: The Fifi

The first time I stayed a Hicksville, I stayed in [The Fifi](https://www.hicksvillepalace.com/the-fifi-trailer).

This trailor was designed as an homage to New Orleans custom wig shop, [Fifi Mahony's Custom Wigs](https://fifisbywater.square.site/). I haven't been to Fifi's New Orleans shop but staying in The Fifi almost made me think I was there. The Fifi features wigs you can try on, a sweet in-trailer bar and a mini fridge, all decked out in the finest 70s shag.

## Noah Purifoy Museum

A short drive from Hicksville Trailor Palace is the [Noah Purifoy](https://www.noahpurifoy.com/) Outdoor Desert Museum. Noah Purifoy was an artist and a founding member of the [Watts Towers Art Center](https://www.wattstowers.org/) in Los Angeles. In the late 1980s, Purifoy moved to the Mojave Desert and spent the last 15 years of his life creating ten acres of large-scale sculptures constructed entirely of junked materials. These images are from my visit in March 2023.

## Until next time

I'm already planning my next trip to the area. I'm scoping out my next trailer at Hicksville. I still need to visit the [Integratron](https://www.integratron.com/) (for which Hicksville's [Integratrailor](https://www.hicksvillepalace.com/the-integratrailer-trailer) is named -- maybe that's my next one) and nearby [Giant Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Rock). I also want to spend more time in Pioneertown. And when I do, I'll be sure to post about my experiences here!
